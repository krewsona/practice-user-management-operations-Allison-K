# practice-user-management-operations-Allison-K
In this activity, I practiced performing basic SQL operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying user data in a MySQL database using MySQL Workbench. I also worked with filters, sorting, and limits to retrieve specific subsets of data.
The most challenging part was making sure the `WHERE` conditions targeted the correct records without accidentally affecting others â€” especially during the update and delete operations.
